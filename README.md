## About this Fork

This epository is being used to develop a new experimental MCP server implementation based on the method described in:

```
@misc{wang2025hierarchicalreasoningmodel,
      title={Hierarchical Reasoning Model}, 
      author={Guan Wang and Jin Li and Yuhao Sun and Xing Chen and Changling Liu and Yue Wu and Meng Lu and Sen Song and Yasin Abbasi Yadkori},
      year={2025},
      eprint={2506.21734},
      archivePrefix={arXiv},
      primaryClass={cs.AI},
      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734}, 
}
```

The goal is to prototype this method following the official MCP framework.



## üöÄ Getting Started

### Using MCP Servers in this Repository
TypeScript-based servers in this repository can be used directly with `npx`.

For example, this will start the [Memory](src/memory) server:
```sh
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

Python-based servers in this repository can be used directly with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/) or [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). `uvx` is recommended for ease of use and setup.

For example, this will start the [Git](src/git) server:
```sh
# With uvx
uvx mcp-server-git

# With pip
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
```

Follow [these](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) instructions to install `uv` / `uvx` and [these](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install `pip`.

### Using an MCP Client
However, running a server on its own isn't very useful, and should instead be configured into an MCP client. For example, here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the above server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

Additional examples of using the Claude Desktop as an MCP client might look like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-git", "--repository", "path/to/git/repo"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    },
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "postgresql://localhost/mydb"]
    }
  }
}
```
